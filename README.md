# LibriVox Obsolete

This repository contains the public code dump of the [Rebuild
LibriVox](https://librivox.org/2012/04/05/100-million-dowloads-and-a-mellon-foundation-grant/)
Melon grant project. While the code here is fairly close to what's actually
running on [librivox.org](https://librivox.org/), enough is missing that it
can't actually be deployed anywhere. There exists a private repository with the
"real" code as it was at the time of the code dump. Both have been obsoleted by
[librivox-catalog](https://github.com/LibriVox/librivox-catalog), which
contains the code currently running at [librivox.org](https://librivox.org/),
and [librivox-ansible](https://github.com/LibriVox/librivox-ansible), which
contains the Ansible playbooks that deploy LibriVox.
